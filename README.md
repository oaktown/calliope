## Setting up Go and cloning the repo

### Mac
Install using homebrew:

```
brew install go
brew install dep # Dependency management
```

Go requires your project directory to be a subdirectory of `$GOPATH/src`. Go expects all
of your go projects to be under this path. To get the code and put it in the right path, use the `go get` command (instead of `git clone`)

```bash
go get github.com/oaktown/calliope.git
cd $GOPATH
cd src/github.com/oaktown/calliope # Project directory
dep ensure # Update dependencies
```
The last line shouldn't cause any changes since we're checking all dependencies into `vendor` (because, unlike npm or ruby gems, there is no registry â€“ if owners rename repos, it would cause a problem for anyone using their packages.)

### Install Elasticsearch using Docker

This is adapted from olivere's [elastic-with-docker repo](https://github.com/olivere/elastic-with-docker).

In the project directory, type:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up # this will run in the foreground
```

This will download the docker images (if you don't have them already) and run Elasticsearch on port 9200.

To test on the terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```

You should get a response like:

```json
{
  "name" : "EpNbYZk",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "Z0St0x6PTPyprNKMhWhNrg",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.4.0",
    "build_flavor" : "oss",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "595516e",
    "build_date" : "2018-08-17T23:18:47.308994Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.4.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

If you want data to persist (from [elastic-with-docker repo](https://github.com/olivere/elastic-with-docker)):

> Make sure to create a ./data directory locally and uncomment the volumes section in Docker Compose file(s) if you want your data to be persistent.

Note: `data` has been added to .gitignore

To delete your containers (e.g. if you don't want to save what's in Elasticsearch and haven't put stuff in the data directory), type:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
```

There's a Chrome extension called [ElasticSearch Head](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elasticsearch-head/ffmkiejjmecolpfloofpjologoblkegm) that you might find useful.

### Setup a Google Cloud project

We were inspired by https://github.com/vcollak/GmailContacts, which has nice
setup instructions.

## Build and run the app

When building the app `-i` will build all the dependencies and `-v` prints
out what its building.  The following commands will generate an executable
called `calliope` in the same directory and then run it:

```bash
go build -i -v
./calliope
```
or you can use `go run`:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This command will display help.

Note: One of the options for several commands is an url to open the thread in Gmail (not the specific email, just the thread that it's in). 
By default, the url is `https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox/<thread id>`, but if you are logged into more than one
account, can pass in a modified url. For example:

```bash
go build
./calliope download -l 1000 -d "2018/01/01" -u "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2"
```

or

```bash
go run main.go download -l 1000 -d "2018/01/01" -u "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/"
```

will link to the 3rd logged in account. See also [Debugging](#debugging), below.

### Config

In addition to command line options, you can provide a configuration file (currently named calliope.yml, and currently stored in the working directory, although this will change eventually). Currently, it only has one option: `exclude_headers_with_values` which can be used to exclude messages from being saved into Elasticsearch (useful if you want to filter out automated notifications, email lists, etc.). There is a sample file `calliope-example.yml` that shows a configuration to exclude common mailing lists.

### Oauth

The first time you run the application, you will be prompted to give permission (via Oauth) like so:

```
====> Get ready to authenticate....

Open the link below in your browser. To give permission to view your email, click 'Allow' then copy the code...

https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=551888752777-k3ahicnth2t1n7c08jm2vhqempvi21ek.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.readonly&state=state-token

Paste the code here:
```

Paste the link into a browser and you will need to grant the app permission
to read your email.  Then it will display a new page with an access code.  If
you copy and paste into your terminal, it will print out some debugging logs.
(The app is a work in progress, and this is as far as we've gotten.)


```
Saving credential file to: oauth_token.json
```

Note: Next time, it will use the saved token instead of prompting you.

### Deleting index
You can use `curl` to delete an email from the index using its id:
```bash
curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/mail/document/<id>
```

Or you can delete the entire index:
```bash
curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/mail
```

## Unit tests
To run tests:

```bash
go test ./gmailservice
```

Note: If you find a problematic email and want to download it locally e.g. to add as a test fixture, 
you can get it using curl, too:

```bash
curl localhost:9200/mail/document/<id> > fixture.json
```

Removing stuff you don't need for the test would be nice, too, as it would make it easier to find 
relevant data in the fixture.

## Debugging
   
To debug, install [Delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve). Follow the installation 
instructions for your OS, then you can run it like:

```bash
dlv debug main.go -- download -q "is:starred label:devchix" -l 10 -R
```

Note: The `--` separates `dlv` commandline args from the commandline args of the program being debugged.
